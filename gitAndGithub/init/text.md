**1. The first step is to install** [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), which is Git + a GUI for Git. If you prefer to use Git via the command line (i.e., without a GUI), you can [install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) instead.

**2. Next, initialize a repository.** Let us assume you want to version control content in a specific directory. In that case, you need to initialize a Git repository in that directory. Here are the steps:

Create a directory for the repo (e.g., a directory named `things`).

<tabs>
  <tab header="SourceTree">
    <include src="./sourcetree.md" />
  </tab>
  <tab header="CLI">
    <include src="./cli.md" />
  </tab>
</tabs>
